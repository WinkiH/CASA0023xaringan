  abstract = {Abstract National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission was launched in September 2018 with the primary goal of monitoring our rapidly changing polar regions. The sole instrument onboard, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System, is now providing routine, very high-resolution, surface elevation data across the globe, including the Arctic and Southern oceans. In this study, we demonstrate our new processing chain for converting the along-track ICESat-2 sea ice freeboard product (ATL10) into sea ice thickness, focusing our initial efforts on the Arctic Ocean. For this conversion, we primarily make use of snow depth and density data from the NASA Eulerian Snow on Sea Ice Model. The coarse resolution ( 100 km) snow data are redistributed onto the high-resolution (approximately 30–100 m) ATL10 freeboards using relationships obtained from snow depth and freeboard data collected by NASA's Operation IceBridge mission. We present regional sea ice thickness distributions and highlight their seasonal evolution through our first winter season of data collection. We include ice thickness uncertainty estimates, while also acknowledging the limitations of these estimates. We generate a gridded monthly thickness product and compare this with various monthly sea ice thickness estimates obtained from European Space Agency's CryoSat-2 satellite mission, with ICESat-2 showing consistently lower thicknesses. Finally, we compare our February/March 2019 thickness estimates to ICESat February/March (19 February to 21 March) 2008 ice thickness estimates using the same input assumptions, which show an  0.37 m or  20\% thinning across an inner Arctic Ocean domain in this 11-year time period.},

  abstract = {NASA’s Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) launched in fall 2018 and has since collected continuous elevation data over the Earth’s surface. The primary scientific objective is to measure the cryosphere for studies related to land ice and sea ice characteristics. The vantage point from space, however, provides the opportunity to measure global surfaces including oceans, land, and vegetation. The ICESat-2 mission has dedicated products to the represented surface types, including an along-track elevation profile of terrain and canopy heights (ATL08). This study presents the first look at the ATL08 product and the quantitative assessment of the canopy and terrain height retrievals as compared to airborne lidar data. The study also provides qualitative examples of ICESat-2 observations from selected ecosystems to highlight the broad capability of the satellite for vegetation applications. Analysis of the mission’s preliminary ATL08 data product accuracy using an ICESat-2 transect over a vegetated region of Finland indicates a 5 m offset in geolocation knowledge (horizontal accuracy) well within the 6.5 m mission requirement. The vertical RMSE for the terrain and canopy height retrievals for one transect are 0.85 m and 3.2 m respectively.},

  abstract = {Taking stock of our losses                            Earth's ice sheets are melting and sea levels are rising, so it behooves us to understand better which climate processes are responsible for how much of the mass loss. Smith               et al.               estimated grounded and floating ice mass change for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets from 2003 to 2019 using satellite laser altimetry data from NASA's ICESat and ICESat-2 satellites. They show how changing ice flow, melting, and precipitation affect different regions of ice and estimate that grounded-ice loss averaged close to 320 gigatons per year over that period and contributed 14 millimeters to sea level rise.

We provide unified estimates of grounded and floating ice mass change from 2003 to 2019 using NASA’s Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) and ICESat-2 satellite laser altimetry. Our data reveal patterns likely linked to competing climate processes: Ice loss from coastal Greenland (increased surface melt), Antarctic ice shelves (increased ocean melting), and Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers (dynamic response to ocean melting) was partially compensated by mass gains over ice sheet interiors (increased snow accumulation). Losses outpaced gains, with grounded-ice loss from Greenland (200 billion tonnes per year) and Antarctica (118 billion tonnes per year) contributing 14 millimeters to sea level. Mass lost from West Antarctica’s ice shelves accounted for more than 30\% of that region’s total.},
