.center[# Facts about ICESat-2 satellite
]

* Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 launched by NASA

* Launched at 15 September 2018

* Currently in services at its "Cycle 22" 

* Previous generation is ICESat which decommissioned from operations on 14 August 2010

.center[# Missions and visions
]

* To monitor mass balance in:
  * Cryosphere -- topography and volume of ice sheets, glaciers, and sea ice
  
  * Hydrosphere -- terrestial water body e.g., lake, sub- and supraglacial lake, ocean dynamics e.g., ocean surface height and circulation
  
  * Biosphere -- vegetation/ canopy cover (biomass)

* To provide open data source at 3 levels for the NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center  `r Citep(myBib,"tc-14-1519-2020")`

* Active sensors -- Six-beam Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) on-board

* Measures the returning time of the laser signal to determine the distance between ICESat-2 and ground surface, thus, topography

* ATLAS sends out 10000 pulses per second of laser lights at 532 nanometers and bright green visible spectrum
